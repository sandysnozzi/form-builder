# form-builder
This is a repository dedicated to describing my work with the web application 
I designed and programmed at my internship with WEC International. 

Since my specific work and code for the organization are private,
I will summarize the general frontend and backend programming experience. 

Purpose of the form builder application : Create an easy, user-friendly and secure platform 
for WEC International employees in charge of various programs to create, 
send and receive application or information forms. 

Application Platform Description:
Through the application, regular users are able to create, edit, and 
send forms in addition to the general settings of modifying username 
and passwords. To build the forms, users are given options to create
sections and subsections of questions that can be made to be whether 
multiple choice, long answer, short anser, file upload or other kinds
of questions. 
At the end the user would need to write the designated contact email,
which will be the email receiving a secure and encrypted submitted form. 

The administrator of the program has access to other users' forms 
and can modify, edit or delete those forms as needed. 

Languages Used: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP
